What is dragonpilot?
------

[Dragonpilot](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot/) is a fork of [comma ai](https://comma.ai/) [openpilot](http://github.com/commaai/openpilot) which is an open source driver assistance system. Currently, dragonpilot performs the functions of forms the functions of Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Automated Lane Centering (ALC), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Road sign decection(RSA), Map based speed rate control(Mapd), Smart MDPS other features. Dragonpilot is intended to be ran on Toyota/Lexus but we also support Honda, Hyundia, Kia, volkswagen, subaru but feature maybe limited. In addition, while openpilot is engaged, a camera based Driver Monitoring (DM) feature alerts distracted and asleep drivers. See more about [the vehicle integration](docs/INTEGRATION.md) and [limitations](docs/LIMITATIONS.md).


Running in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things
* This software. It's free and available right here.
* One of [the 150+ supported cars](docs/CARS.md). We support Honda, Toyota, Hyundai, Nissan, Kia, Chrysler, Lexus, Acura, Audi, VW, and more. If your car is not supported, but has adaptive cruise control and lane keeping assist, it's likely able to run openpilot.
* A supported device to run this software. This can be a [comma two](https://comma.ai/shop/products/two) and [comma three](https://comma.ai/shop/products/three). We do not offical support Mr.One hardware.
* A way to connect to your car. With a comma two or three, you need only a [car harness](https://comma.ai/shop/products/car-harness). With an EON Gold or One Plus 3t, you also need a [black panda](https://comma.ai/shop/products/panda) or second generation hardware like comma .

[Comma](https://comma.ai/) has detailed instructions for [how to install the device in a car](https://comma.ai/setup). We do not offer support.

Community and Contributing
------

dragonpilot is developed by [efini](https://github.com/eFiniLan) and [kumar](https://github.com/rav4kumar) and by users like you. We welcome both pull requests and issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/dragonpilot-community/dragonpilot/). Bug fixes and new car ports are encouraged. Check out [the contributing docs](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Documentation related to openpilot development can be found on [docs.comma.ai](https://docs.comma.ai). Information about running openpilot (e.g. FAQ, fingerprinting, troubleshooting, custom forks, community hardware) should go on the [wiki](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot/wiki).

You can add support for your car by following guides we have written for [Brand](https://blog.comma.ai/how-to-write-a-car-port-for-openpilot/) and [Model](https://blog.comma.ai/openpilot-port-guide-for-toyota-models/) ports. Generally, a car with adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist is a good candidate. [Join our Discord](https://discord.comma.ai) to discuss car ports: most car makes have a dedicated channel.

User Data and comma Account
------

By default, dragopilot doesn't upload data to comma servers. You may enable data collection and forwarding to either comma or retropilot.api via toggle under DP general.

dragonpilot may logs the road facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.

Safety and Testing
----

* dragonpilot observes ISO26262 guidelines, see [SAFETY.md](docs/SAFETY.md) for more details.
* ~~dragonpilot has software in the loop [tests](.github/workflows/selfdrive_tests.yaml) that run on every commit.~~ soon-ish
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://github.com/commaai/panda#code-rigor) for more details.
* panda has software in the loop [safety tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/tree/master/tests/safety).
* Internally, we have a hardware in the loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware in the loop [tests](https://github.com/commaai/panda/blob/master/Jenkinsfile).
